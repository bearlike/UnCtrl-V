## What does it do?
Types the content of your Clipboard rather than pasting it. I (might) use this to type in places that forbids pasting into them (exam portals, Code Editors, etc.).

## How to run it?
- Python Compiler (3.7 Recommended). Currently works only on Windows.
- Necessary Python3 Libraries can be installed by running the following command:
  - ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Run `main.py` and voila, start UnPasting.
  - There is a 5 seconds delay after pressing the "**Click here to Type the Clipboard**" to set the cursor in the right place.
  - ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
